I set up this Python repo as per [these excellent guidelines](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/).

## Day1: TIL

### Neat trick to work around path issues

I found when running tests, I was using relative referencing to get to data files, and that would work differently depending on where in the directory structure I ran the code from.

To work around it, I found [this little snippet](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32527861/python-unit-test-that-uses-an-external-data-file), which uses `Path` to work it out:

```
from pathlib import Path
THIS_DIR = Path(__file__).parent

# construct path like this:
THIS_DIR.parent /'data/day1_sample.txt'
```
## Day 3: TIL

### Building blocks

Taking a "building blocks" approach to these challenges means I have to re-write less between parts.

So, for example, today:
1. a function to read in the data as arrays of bits
2. a separate function to transform arrays of bits into counts

Keeping those two bits separate meant I could just reuse those for the second part.

### Counter helpers

Using Counters in Python gets a bit fiddly because you're accessing the Counter (dictionary), a list of tuples (most_common()), so you end up with things like `counter[0][0]` which is hard to decipher without context.

I created two simple helper lambdas to make it a touch more readable:

```
most_common = lambda counter: counter.most_common()[0][0]
least_common = lambda counter: counter.most_common()[-1][0]
```

## Day 15

I attempted to figure out my own solution starting from naive / brute-force recursion, then trying to prune paths by using heuristics - but for the large grid this was intractable.

Then I learned about A* and got to a solution for ‚≠ê fairly quickly.

For part 2, I created a `ChitonMap` class which figures out the chiton risk dynamically, then adapted the A* function to use it. HOWEVER...

On first attempt, the function failed to find a path. I realised that the issue was that I was initialising my default "g" (path to node) values using 999, which with the big grid was a pretty normal score.

I solved that üêõ by setting the default to infinity. HOWEVER..

I then got an answer that was too high. I realised I had limited movement to down and right only, so I allowed up and left as well, and then got to the right answer ‚úå
